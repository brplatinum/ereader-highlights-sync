“How’s it going? I just arrived in St. Augustine. Long drive.” “I’m well,” she says. She never says “I’m well.” It sounds formal somehow. Distant. “Good,” I say. “How’s the shoot?” “It’s going well.” Two wells.

For example, your blink reflex is extremely fast precisely because it’s implemented by a small and simple circuit that doesn’t involve most of your brain: if that hard-to-swat fly accidentally heads toward your eye, you’ll blink within a tenth of a second, long before the relevant information has had time to spread throughout your brain and make you consciously aware of what happened.

In contrast, it’s plausible that long before two superintelligent civilizations encounter one another, their technologies will plateau at the same level, limited merely by the laws of physics.

Figure 6.11: Are we alone? The huge uncertainties about how life and intelligence evolved suggest that our nearest neighbor civilization in space could reasonably be anywhere along the horizontal axis above, making it unlikely that it’s in the narrow range between the edge of our Galaxy (about 1021 meters away) and the edge of our Universe (about 1026 meters away). If it were much closer than this range, there should be so many other advanced civilizations in our Galaxy that we’d probably have noticed, which suggests that we’re in fact alone in our Universe.

Confronted with the fact that there are millions of habitable Earth-like planets in our Galaxy that are billions of years older than Earth, giving ample time for ambitious inhabitants to settle the Galaxy, we therefore can’t dismiss the most obvious interpretation: that the origin of life requires a random fluke so unlikely that they’re all uninhabited.
